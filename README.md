## Description

## Requirements

- [x] Creare una repository su GitHub
- [ ] Create an SDN network in mininet with multiple switches
- [ ] Create a software that is capable of deploying services in the network
  - Services are composed of multiple applications that communicate together to deliver the service (e.g., web server and database)
- [ ] Create a GUI (python recommended) capable of:
  - Deploying service in the network (i.e., starting required applications on existing hosts)
    - Basic idea: choose host depending on usage (e.g., max 2 applications per host)
  - Choose communication requirements for applications
    - Choose communication requirements for applications
    - Choose communication requirements for applications
  - Stopping applications
    - Upon stopping, remove flows if not required anymore
- [ ] Show that applications can actually talk
  - Example of communicating applications are a web server and a database (create fake ones)
